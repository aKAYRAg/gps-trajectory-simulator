# üöö GPS Trajectory Simulator with Realistic Timing and Noise

This project simulates GPS route data using **real road network data** from OpenStreetMap (OSM).  
It incorporates **realistic timing** based on road types, traffic patterns, and junction delays.  
Additionally, it can generate **GPS noise** to simulate sensor inaccuracies and  
simulate **off-route anomalies** where vehicles deviate from the planned route and then return.

## üß† Features

- Realistic routing using OSM road network  
- Speed estimation based on road type and urban context  
- Time-of-day traffic modifiers (e.g., rush hour slowdowns)- Random delays at intersections (junctions)  
- Timestamp generation for each GPS point
- Off-route anomaly injection simulating route deviations and returns  
- Optional GPS noise injection to simulate real-world GPS drift

## üì¶ Requirements

Install Python dependencies with:

```bash
pip install osmnx networkx pandas numpy geopy
```

---

## üöÄ Usage

Generate Normal Route:

```bash
python generate_normalroute.py
```

Saves clean, timestamped GPS routes to dataset/normal_route/.

Generate Route with Anomalies

```bash
python generate_offroute.py
```
Saves GPS routes containing off-route deviations to dataset/off_route/.

The following aspects can be adjusted inside the script:

| Parameter                  | Description                                   | Example / Default                                                         |

## üìç Example Coordinates Used

```python
origin_coords = (40.3233635,28.0000311)         
destination_coords = (40.825069,29.9252826)
```

You can replace these with any coordinates globally.

## üïí Performance Note

When simulating long routes or wide areas (e.g., across cities), you may see a warning like this:

```
UserWarning: This area is 16 times your configured Overpass max query area size...
```

This means OSMnx is automatically splitting the request into smaller sub-queries, which **can take several minutes** depending on internet speed and the Overpass server's load. Be patient ‚Äî the result is cached locally for faster future runs.

To avoid pushing large temporary files, add the following to your `.gitignore`:

```
__pycache__/
.osmnx_cache/
```
